As a developer, I always try to learn as many things I can, either back-end or front-end technologies, programming languages and frameworks. Of course that with the plenty of new things popping out everyday, I think that it's (really) hard to master a deep knowledge as a full-stack developer. But it doesn't mean that we could try! :)

So, I decided to begin some experiments with [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/). Vue (pronounced as _view_) is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user-interfaces. It came out in 2014, and have [been growing more and more in popularity](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/vue-js).

The comparison with React, its almost inevitable. Despite its similarities, this two frameworks has a lot of [differences](https://br.vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html). Instead of defend one or other, I'll simple explain why I chose _Vuejs_ over React to begin my learn journey through the front-end development! The main reason was (I must admit) my lazyness! There's a feeling today that to begin a simple Javascript project you need to understand at least a little of ES6, Transpilers, Compilers, Build process, etc...

You can use some generator to creates an opinionated structure with all this things already configured, but I don't think it's a good ideia, because you'll see so much things that you don't understand, that it can delay any simple change in a "hello world" app. So, I decided to play with Vuejs, like some years ago, just inserting an script tag in a simple html file and begin to write Javascript code in this very same file (miss you JQuery...haha).
